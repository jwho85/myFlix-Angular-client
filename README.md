# MyFlixAngularClient

The objective of this project was to build the client-side for an application called myFlix based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database), with supporting documentation.

## Tech

<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Angular</li>
<li>Angular Material</li>
<li>Angular Router</li>
</ul>

## The 5 Ws

1. Who—The users of the myFlix movie app and codebase, including other developers and designers. 
2. What—A single-page, responsive movie app built with Angular, with routing and several interface views. The client-side developed in this Achievement will support the existing server-side from Achievement 2 by facilitating user requests and rendering the response from the server-side via a number of different interface views. The app will be accompanied by relevant documentation and handoff deliverables, including a kanban board containing user stories and story points. 
3. When—Users will be able to use the app whenever they want to read information about different movies or update their user information. 
4. Where—The app will be hosted online. It is responsive and can therefore be used anywhere and on any device, giving all users an equal experience. 
5. Why—Movie enthusiasts like to be able to access information about different movies, directors, and genres whenever they want. The app will demonstrate your Angular skills and your ability to create straightforward documentation for other developers and employers.

## User Stories

<ul> 
<li>As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I can learn more about movies I’ve watched or am interested in.</li>
<li>As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.</li> 
</ul>

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
